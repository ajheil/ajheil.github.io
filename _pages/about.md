I am PhD candidate in economics at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/research-students/anton-heil/"> London School of Economics</a>. Before starting the PhD, I worked as a research manager at the LSE and as a consultant at the World Bank. I hold a BA in Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth and an MA in Economics from University of California, Berkeley. 

My research is in Development Economics.
