  This project studies the relationship of occupational variety with economic growth. Using various data sources, we document a robust empirical pattern linking the two variables across countries, over time and within a large emerging economy: Brazil. Workers in the poorest places typically chose between a handful of job types while rich economies offer a large variety of specialised occupations. This appears to be an under-appreciated aspect of structural transformation. In ongoing theoretical and empirical work, we try to explain the mechanisms underlying this pattern. We aim to answer two questions. How do new occupations emerge as economies grow? And can an increase in occupational variety itself lead to further productivity gains? Focusing for now on the second question, a preliminary model shows how occupations can allow horizontally heterogenous workers to exploit comparative advantage across tasks. More occupations allow a better match between workers' task-specific productivity and the tasks provided by the occupation which they chose, thus increasing labour productivity.
