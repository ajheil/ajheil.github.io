abstract: >
  Public works programs are among the most common social protection schemes in low and middle-income countries. They have the potential to offer effective social protection to agriculture-dependent communities facing increasingly frequent and severe weather. Yet, one important aspect of these programs is understudied: does the public infrastructure constructed through the programs improve agricultural productivity and resilience?  To tackle this question, I assemble a novel dataset of 80 million small-scale infrastructure projects constructed through Indiaâ€™s public works program (NREGA). Preliminary results show that the amount and type of construction respond to local weather shocks.
