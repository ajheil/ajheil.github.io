abstract: >
Graduation programs provide a targeted bundle of interventions that address participants basic needs, kick start income generating activities through asset and skill transfers, facilitate financial inclusion and promote social empowerment. This approach has been adapted to many contexts, but the goal is always to permanently improve participants welfare by enabling them to take up profitable and self-sustaining work. Initially developed in the non-government sector, the approach is increasingly incorporated into governmentsâ€™ social protection schemes around the world. This chapter details the workings of the graduation approach, the philosophy behind its design, its diverse applications, and the evidence of its impact
